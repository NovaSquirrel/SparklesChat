SparklesChat
============

A multi-protocol chat client that feels and acts like XChat/HexChat.

In fact, XChat/HexChat addons should mostly work, but plugins have many more functions they can call
and there is a Squirrel scripting system provided, which is used to implement most features and the protocols.
